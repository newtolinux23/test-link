* Project: HTML5 Bio (Aerial Template)

* Overview
  This project is a personal bio page using the "Aerial" template from HTML5 UP. The main update includes the addition of a circular profile picture above the name while maintaining the original design and animations.

* Changes Made
  - Added a profile picture (profile.jpg) above the name in `index.html`.
  - Updated `index.html` to include an `<img>` tag for the profile picture.
  - Styled the profile picture using CSS to appear as a circular image with a white border.
  - Ensured that all existing animations and design elements remain intact.

* Files Modified
  - *index.html*
    - Inserted an `<img>` tag with class `profile-pic` above the `<h1>` containing the name.
  - *assets/css/main.css*
    - Added the following CSS rule for the circular profile picture:

  #+BEGIN_SRC css
    .profile-pic {
        width: 150px;
        height: 150px;
        border-radius: 50%;
        display: block;
        margin: 0 auto 15px;
        border: 3px solid #fff;
    }
  #+END_SRC

* How to Use
  1. Place your profile image in the `assets/images/` directory and rename it to `profile.jpg`.
  2. Open `index.html` to confirm that the image is displayed above the name.
  3. Customize the image size and border in `main.css` if needed.

* Notes
  - The original background animations and responsive design remain unchanged.
  - Ensure that `profile.jpg` exists in the correct path to avoid broken image issues.
  - You can replace `profile.jpg` with another image, updating the `src` attribute in `index.html` if necessary.
